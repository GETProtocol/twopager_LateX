\textit{The GET Protocol is a blockchain-based protocol that is used by ticketing companies to completely merge the primary and secondary ticketing market. The protocol gives complete control over the sale and trade between ticket holder from the moment the first ticket is sold until the last ticket is scanned. The platform's own ERC20 token, the GET, functions as a FIAT value locking asset in a user's wallet/smart ticket. The FIAT value of GET is set at the start of an event cycle. By this value locking mechanism all actors are shielded from crypto volatility during an event cycle. GUTS Tickets is based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and has a working smart ticketing application that is already used by big event organizers in the Netherlands. This experience and operational readiness of its team makes the company perfectly positioned to develop the GET Protocol as the company is able to build the protocol and improve and deploy it incrementally.}

\caption{ \textbf{The difference between GUTS Tickets and the GET Foundation. } }
\end{wraptable}

The ticketing company \textbf{GUTS} is currently selling blockchain-registered tickets via its smart-ticketing application. In 2017 alone the company sold tickets for more than 30 events totaling more than 10.000 tickets. Where traditional ticketing companies provide a buyer with a static QR code, the GUTS application serves the user with a dynamic QR code that changes as a function over time and owner. One of the Netherlands most prominent theater companies, \href{https://hekwerk.nl/}{\textcolor{gutsoranje}{Hekwerk Theaterproducties}}, have partnered with GUTS and its team. \href{https://blog.guts.tickets/the-hekwerk-deal-7554071b26c1}{\textcolor{gutsoranje}{This deal alone}} secures protocol usage for more than 310.000 tickets in 2019. Several prominent artists and their management, one of which is \href{https://blog.guts.tickets/advisory-board-of-get-watse-de-jong-manager-martin-garrix-nyle-budimlic-cypher-group-32ec30ce06ae}{\textcolor{gutsoranje}{Martin Garrix}}, have shown their support for our vision of a efficient and transparent primary and secondary ticketing market, cutting out the profits made by parties adding little to no value in the value chain. The protocol allows ticket owners to resell their ticket anonymously to other consumers directly in the web-app without the risk of being defrauded or getting  scalping with fees/excessive margins. 

\textbf{We are live.} The GET Protocol is more than a white paper or a proof of concept. It is reality. GUTS Tickets is already selling smart tickets registered on the blockchain. After the crowdsale is completed other functionalities as reselling tickets within a price margin will be added to the protocols functionality. Check out the \href{https://events.guts.tickets/events}{\textcolor{gutsoranje}{events}} we ticket for or try out the \href{https://sandbox.guts.tickets/events/8}{\textcolor{gutsoranje}{sandbox}} environment and experience the future of ticketing for yourself.

\subsection*{The Actors within the GET Protocol}
The Guaranteed Entrance Token (GET): transparent and open smart ticketing protocol for any event with regulated admission. The GET Protocol provides primary actors in the event space the following benefits:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Users:} GET ensures that event participants enjoy a secure and stress-free ticketing experience, and provides a simple and inexpensive way for ticket holders who cannot attend the event to securely sell their tickets to other users.
        \item \textbf{Content-creators:} The GET Protocol prohibits commercial ticket resellers from disturbing the value chain; artists can be certain that their fans pay a fair price for a guaranteed, authentic ticket (as the dynamic QR can't be sold outside of the protocol).
        \item \textbf{Event organizers:} GET provides a scalable ticketing protocol to manage ticket sales for any size events in a secure and controlled manner. GET controls the true cost of transactions and the blockchain ensures both the true price and properties of tickets, thus eliminating middlemen from the value chain. The protocol increases market efficiency as a whole while increasing margins for the stakeholders delivering actual value. 
        \item \textbf{Venues:} GET provides users with an honest and fraud-free experience that promotes a higher occupancy rate of the venue. Venues also enjoy the benefits of clean customer data as there are not reseller platforms that corrupt accurate of the attendees attending.  
    \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{About GUTS Ticketing and the GET platform:}
% GUTS is a ticketing system which uses blockchain technology to register ownership of SMART-tickets. GUTS makes ticket fraud impossible. The ticket can only be (re)sold at a fixed price, so no more disgraceful prices for (secondary) tickets. GUTS ticketing is an Amsterdam based company with 8 full time employees and a working and operational smart ticketing application. GUTS partnered up with several industry players that are currently using the application. The GET-protocol described in the white paper builds upon industry experience and describes a protocol, powered by the Guaranteed Entrance Token, that can be used by ticketing companies all over the world.

\paragraph{Go to market strategy} While bypassing all current ticketing stakeholders to create a new and completely disruptive platform seems tempting, GUTS Tickets has learned over the last 16 months that this strategy would ultimately fail. The thresholds required to penetrate the market are too great, and adoption of the GET Protocol would be severely limited. To maximize the chances for adoption, the GET Foundation, supported by launching customer GUTS Tickets, will collaborate with current market stakeholders and will use existing infrastructure in the value chain. GUTS Tickets has partnered, and the GET Foundation will partner, with several powerhouses in the business to build desired features and functions, and these industry experts are helping us avoid mistakes and misconceptions about the market.\\

% \subsection*{User Growth Fund (UGF)}
% The user growth fund will act as a mechanism of distributing GET to users buying tickets on the GET-protocol. Users buying smart tickets for an event on the GET-protocol will get an ethereum wallet associated with their user -account. To this wallet an event-specific amount of GET is transferred. The GET needed to resell a event ticket on the internal secondary market will be sponsored by the the fund for as long as the UGF fund is liquid enough to do so. This token distribution mechanism is deemed effective as it demonstrates, to the end-users, one of the main advantages of the GET-protocol; complete fee-transparency and fair cost-allocation. It is projected that the GET tokens in this fund will be distributed to the GET wallets of 8.9 million users of the GET-protocol. The same projections, based on industry margins and payment processor costs, report that this fund will be depleted in 2022. 

% \subsection*{Stability Fund (SF) }
% This fund will act as the gateway of the GET-Protocol and is a smart-contract that is able to hold both GET and ETH. This fund has a quite prominent role in the GET-Protocol as it acts as a funnel for GET from the open market to be bought (exchanged) and used for ticketing by event organizers. In this role as gateway the stability fund achieves two of its functions, firstly providing the event organizers with the GET this actor needs to create smart tickets and account for the underlying ticket value during an event-cycle. Immediately after having sold the GET to the event organizer (for Ether) the contract will open a buy (exchange) contract towards the open market. This buy (exchange) contract will offer to buy (exchange) GET for Ether from the open market. The price (exchange rate) for this buy (exchange) contract will be provided by the GET pricing oracle (GPO).



% The stability fund will contain a significant amount of tokens at instantiation of the protocol. The function of this fund is to provide event organizers and more importantly; the end-user holding a smart-ticket for an event, a certain level of price-stability. This stability is necessary as the end-user isn't directly aware he or she is holding a crypto asset on their account, as the protocol and its token is used as a backbone for cost-accounting. Therefore these stakeholders should be shielded from GET value fluctuations in order to guarantee that these fluctuations don't impact the user experience of ticket holders. \\

% \par The stability fund provides this stability to these stakeholders by pegging the internal price denomination of one GET to \euro0.50. If the stability fund is depleted this internal price-pegging will be discontinued and the GET value will be set by the market. At the same time users will be able to access their ethereum wallets connected to their user accounts and possibly transfer the tokens they received when buying event tickets GET-protocol.

% The amount of GET needed is calculated by an algorithm (see page \pageref{formula_a} for more about this calculation. During the period that the initial growth fund is liquid, $ P_{res} $ costs will be subsidized. When both the stability and the growth fund are depleted, the market is assumed to be liquid and stable enough, market prices will then be used in the per-event evaluation of total transaction costs / needed value.

% \subsection*{The protocols guaranteed exchange rate}
% As the GET token is needed in order for event organizers to sell and assign smart tickets on the GET-protocol, this will create a demand for tokens. The protocol will regulate and facilitate this GET acquisition process to ensure that event organizers can easily and cost-effectively interact with the protocol. 

% \subsection*{Budget Allocation:}
% All funds raised during the ICO will be managed by the GET Protocol foundation. This foundation will be a different legal entity as GUTS ticketing. As GUTS is a ticketing company using the GET-protocol. The foundation will control all the funds mentioned and will coordinate, finance and be responsible for the development and adoption of the GET-protocol.

% GET Foundation: GUTS Tickets came to the conclusion that to truly unleash a revolution in the ticketing industry, the technology it developed should be further developed and operated from within a separate foundation so other ticketing companies will be able to make use of the GET-protocol . Moreover, GUTS Tickets realised that in order to increase the pace and expand scope, such a foundation would require sufficient resources. 

% This is why a separate foundation fully dedicated to designing the GET-Protocol has been incorporated: de Stichting GET Protocol Foundation (the GET Foundation, trade registry number 69771138) a foundation incorporated in and under the laws of the Netherlands. A Foundation under Dutch law has a board, and does not have shareholders or members. It may operate a business, employ persons, own assets and enter into agreements. Importantly, however, a foundation under Dutch law may not distribute profits.

% The way forward: GUTS Tickets developed and tested what we will here coin the "genesis" version to the GET-Protocol, which will be further developed and tested by the GET Foundation. As we will explain in further chapters, GUTS Tickets will transfer the requisite assets to the GET Foundation and will serve as launching customer of the GET-Protocol. As the GET-Protocol moves to a fully distributed smart event ecosystem, we intend that other event organizers and ticketing companies can use our open source infrastructure to develop their own use case for the GET-Protocol. We want the GET-Protocol and the tools associated with it to become the standard for smart event ticketing. After years of being ripped off and defrauded, festival and theatre visitors deserve a secure, fair and well-engineered event protocol.
